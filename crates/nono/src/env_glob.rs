//! Shared glob matching for environment variable names.
//!
//! Environment variable name patterns appear in more than one place: the
//! allow/deny lists that decide which variables a sandboxed child inherits,
//! and the redaction patterns that decide which names and values are scrubbed
//! from diagnostics and audit output. The grammar lives here once rather than
//! being reimplemented per call site, so that identical pattern text selects
//! the identical set of variable names wherever it is configured: an author
//! who writes `ACME_*` in two lists cannot be surprised by one of them
//! matching a name the other misses.
//!
//! Sharing a matcher is not sharing policy. Denying a variable does not
//! redact it and redacting one does not deny it — the lists are configured
//! independently, and the only guarantee made here is that the same pattern
//! matches the same way in each. Which pattern belongs in which list, and
//! which entries one list derives from another, is the caller's decision;
//! see `diagnostics.redaction.extra_env_vars` in `nono-cli`.
//!
//! The grammar is deliberately minimal: `*` is the only wildcard, it matches
//! any run of zero or more characters, and the match is anchored to the full
//! name. There are no character classes, no `?`, and no escaping, so a
//! pattern can never match a proper substring of a name by accident.

/// Whether `text` matches `pattern`.
///
/// `*` may appear anywhere in `pattern` — leading, trailing, or infix — and
/// matches any run of zero or more characters: `"AWS_*"`, `"*_TOKEN"`,
/// `"*SECRET*"`, and `"AWS_*_TOKEN"` are all valid. A bare `"*"` matches
/// everything. Every other character matches literally, and the match is
/// anchored to the full string, so `"ACME_*"` does not match
/// `"XACME_API_KEY"`.
///
/// An empty pattern never matches. It is invalid input, and treating it as
/// "no constraint" would silently turn into match-all at every call site.
///
/// Matching is byte-exact; callers that want case-insensitive behavior
/// lowercase both sides before calling (see
/// [`str::to_ascii_lowercase`](str::to_ascii_lowercase)).
