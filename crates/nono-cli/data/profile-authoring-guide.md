# nono Profile Authoring Guide

This guide is designed for LLM agents helping users create custom nono profiles. It covers the full profile schema, common patterns, and validation workflow.

## 1. Profile File Location

User profiles live at **`~/.config/nono/profiles/<name>.json`** by default. If
`XDG_CONFIG_HOME` is set, nono uses **`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/nono/profiles/<name>.json`**
instead. In profile JSON path grants, prefer `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME`, `$NONO_CONFIG`, or
`$NONO_PACKAGES` over hardcoded `$HOME/.config/...`.

Profile names must be alphanumeric with hyphens only. No leading or trailing hyphens.

Valid: `my-agent`, `ci-build`, `dev2`
Invalid: `-leading`, `trailing-`, `has spaces`, `special_chars!`

User profiles take precedence over built-in profiles of the same name.

## 2. Minimal Profile Example

```json
{
  "meta": {
    "name": "my-agent",
    "description": "Profile for my agent"
  },
  "groups": {
    "include": []
  },
  "workdir": {
    "access": "readwrite"
  }
}
```

## 3. Section Reference

### meta

| Field         | Type   | Required | Description              |
|---------------|--------|----------|--------------------------|
| `name`        | string | yes      | Profile name             |
| `version`     | string | no       | Semver version string    |
| `description` | string | no       | Human-readable summary   |
| `author`      | string | no       | Author name              |

### extends

Inherit from another profile by name:

```json
{
  "extends": "default"
}
```

- Inheritance chain max depth: 10.
- The CLI `--extends <PROFILE>` flag composes a selected `--profile` for one
  invocation on profile-consuming commands such as `nono run`, `nono wrap`,
  `nono why`, and `nono proxy`. It is repeatable and prepends its bases to the
  profile JSON's `extends` list, preserving left-to-right merge order while
  keeping the selected profile as the final override layer. Inherited grants
  can widen sandbox permissions.
- Scalar fields: child overrides base.
- Array fields (`groups.include`, `groups.exclude`, `commands.allow`, `commands.deny`, `filesystem.*`, `allow_domain`, `deny_domain`, `open_port`, `open_port_range`, `listen_port`, `listen_port_range`, `no_proxy`, `rollback.*`, `upstream_bypass`): child values are appended to base values and deduplicated. To remove inherited entries, use `groups.exclude` for groups; there is no mechanism to remove inherited filesystem paths. For `allow_domain` entries with endpoint rules, rules for the same domain are merged (appended) rather than replaced. `deny_domain` entries are additive — child profiles can only add more denies, never remove inherited ones.
- Map fields (`env_credentials`, `hooks`, `custom_credentials`): child entries are merged into base; child keys override matching base keys.
- `network_profile` supports three-state inheritance via `InheritableValue`: absent = inherit base value, `null` = explicitly clear, string = override. This is the only field that supports null-clearing.
- `open_urls`: if the child provides the field (even as `{}`), it replaces the base entirely. If absent, the base value is inherited. Setting to `null` in JSON is equivalent to omitting it (both inherit the base).
- `workdir`: child overrides base unless child is `"none"` (which inherits the base value instead).

### platform_overrides

Apply per-OS patches to the profile after `extends` resolution. Only the block matching the current platform is merged in; the others are ignored.

```json
{
  "meta": { "name": "myprofile" },
  "filesystem": {
    "read": ["/tmp"]
  },
  "platform_overrides": {
    "macos": {
      "security": { "process_info_mode": "allow_all" },
      "filesystem": { "read": ["/opt/homebrew", "~/Library/Caches"] }
    },
    "linux": {
      "security": { "signal_mode": "isolated", "process_info_mode": "allow_same_sandbox" },
      "filesystem": { "read": ["/usr/lib", "~/.cache"] }
    }
  }
}
```

Merge semantics are identical to `extends`: array fields are dedup-appended, scalar fields are child-wins, deny-lists union. The override can only add or tighten — it cannot remove inherited paths or relax inherited deny rules.

Valid platform keys are `macos`, `linux`, and `windows`. Unrecognised keys are a parse error.

`extends` and `platform_overrides` are not allowed inside an override block. Nesting either is a parse error.

Use `platform_overrides` when a single profile needs different paths or security modes per OS. Use group-level `when` predicates for package-level platform differences that are already handled by built-in groups.

### groups

Controls which policy groups apply to the profile. Group definitions live in `policy.json`; list available groups with `nono profile groups`.

| Field     | Type            | Default | Description |
|-----------|-----------------|---------|-------------|
| `include` | array of string | `[]`    | Policy group names to apply. |
| `exclude` | array of string | `[]`    | Group names to remove from the resolved group set, including inherited defaults. |

### commands

Controls startup-time command gating. These checks run only at launch time and are not enforced on child processes — prefer path-based controls in `filesystem` for strong enforcement.

| Field   | Type            | Default | Description |
|---------|-----------------|---------|-------------|
| `allow` | array of string | `[]`    | Startup-only command allowlist. Deprecated in v0.33.0; retained for existing profiles. |
| `deny`  | array of string | `[]`    | Startup-only command denylist extension. Deprecated in v0.33.0; prefer `filesystem.deny` and narrower grants instead. |

### command_policies

Command policies live under `command_policies`. Use `commands.<name>.executable` to bind a command name to one exact executable file instead of the first PATH match. By default, command mediation rejects pinned executables and direct parent directories that are writable through the session sandbox's capability set. If a low-assurance profile intentionally grants write access overlapping a pinned executable, `commands.<name>.allow_writable_executable` is available as a per-command trust downgrade. It is valid only with an absolute `executable` path; relative paths and bare command names fail validation. For local demos, `command_policies.allow_writable_executables` disables the writable executable and parent-directory trust check across policy, deny-only, and session executable allow-list paths. The agent still invokes the command name through the command-mediation shim. On macOS, command mediation verifies the file before sandboxing but must still exec by path, so sandbox-writable pinned executables are not suitable for high-assurance policies.

Command sandbox path lists (`fs_read`, `fs_write`, `fs_read_file`, `fs_write_file`) may use dynamic provider tokens. `@git:config-files` expands to trusted global/system Git config files, Git file settings (attributes, excludes, commit templates), and the declared target of every `include.path` and `includeIf.*.path` directive — including conditional includes that do not currently fire. `@git:hooks-path` expands to trusted global/system `core.hooksPath` directories. `@git:common-dir` expands to the git common directory (`.git` in a regular repo, or the absolute path to the main repo's `.git` in a worktree). `@git:worktree` expands to the main worktree root (empty in a regular repo). `@git:toplevel` expands to the current checkout root. `@git:toplevel-parent` expands to the parent of the current checkout root. These tokens are opt-in per profile and ignore repo-local/worktree Git config so a checkout cannot grant itself extra host filesystem access.

#### Command-scoped proxy policy

An effective command sandbox whose network policy includes `network.allow_domain` receives a dedicated loopback proxy and a fresh proxy credential. Its proxy policy does not inherit the session sandbox's broader domain allowlist: the session sandbox may allow `"*"`, while the effective command sandbox for controlled `curl` invocations is limited to `github.com`. The session network policy's domain denials still apply. The supervisor replaces proxy-control environment variables immediately before execution, and the command sandbox may connect only to its dedicated proxy. Changing those variables, opting out with `NO_PROXY`, or using direct sockets does not grant access to the session proxy or direct network unless the command sandbox policy separately grants raw TCP access.

Proxy credentials granted by the same effective command sandbox are served by that dedicated proxy. Their reverse routes may reach their configured upstreams and still enforce `endpoint_policy`, but those upstreams are not added to the command's domain allowlist: direct or ordinary forward-proxy access remains denied unless `network.allow_domain` also permits it.

A command sandbox policy that grants a proxy credential without `network.allow_domain` also receives a dedicated proxy. Its domain allowlist is empty, so only its explicitly granted credential routes are usable.

Proxy credentials cannot be combined with `network.allow_all`: unrestricted loopback access would let the command reach a broader proxy and defeat route isolation. On Linux, a raw `tcp_connect_ports` grant that collides with any active nono proxy port also fails closed at launch.

A command-scoped proxy policy needs an active nono proxy. A top-level network policy with `network.allow_domain` activates it in the example below; a command-scoped proxy credential also activates the proxy by itself. If the selected command sandbox requires a scoped proxy but none is available, the command fails closed at launch.

```json
{
  "network": { "allow_domain": ["*"] },
  "command_policies": {
    "commands": {
      "curl": {
        "sandbox": {
          "network": { "allow_domain": ["github.com"] }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

With this profile, `curl https://github.com` is allowed and `curl https://example.com` is denied. Commands that are not mediated by this command policy continue to use the session sandbox's network policy.

The effective command sandbox is selected as follows:

| Invocation | Selected command sandbox |
|---|---|
| Direct command with `from.session` | `commands.<name>.from.session.sandbox` |
| Direct command without `from.session` | `commands.<name>.sandbox` |
| Command launched by another mediated command | `commands.<name>.from.<caller>.sandbox` |
| Matching intercept with its own `sandbox` | The intercept sandbox replaces the selection above |

`commands.<name>.sandbox` and `commands.<name>.from.session` are alternative ways to define direct access and cannot both be present. Chained access also requires the caller's `can_use` entry; there is no fallback from a missing `from.<caller>` edge to the direct sandbox.

Each direct, caller-specific, and intercept command sandbox policy with `network.allow_domain` receives a distinct scoped proxy. For example, direct `curl` may allow `github.com`, while `curl` launched by `git` is independently limited by `curl.from.git.sandbox` to `api.github.com`. `git.sandbox` controls Git itself. Domain allowlists are replaced, not merged: neither the caller's command sandbox nor the non-intercepted command sandbox contributes domains to the selected command sandbox's proxy policy.

`unix_socket_bind` (command sandbox only) grants `connect(2)`/`bind(2)` on named pathname AF_UNIX sockets, with the same implied filesystem coupling as the agent-level field of the same name. It also accepts the `@git:fsmonitor-socket` dynamic token, which expands to `fsmonitor--daemon.ipc` under the current worktree's private git-dir — resolved by a pure filesystem walk (no `git` process spawn), so an attacker-controlled working directory cannot influence resolution through `.git/config`.

```json
{
  "command_policies": {
    "entrypoint": "demonator",
    "commands": {
      "demonator": {
        "executable": "/opt/homebrew/bin/demonator",
        "sandbox": {
          "fs_write": ["/opt/homebrew/bin"]
        },
        "allow_writable_executable": true
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Command-policy denials

Command-policy denials are not filesystem-policy denials. A message like:

```text
nono: command policy denied gh: Command 'gh' is blocked: agents may read issues but not comment on them
```

means the command policy blocked the resolved command invocation. `nono why --path ...` only explains filesystem-policy grants and denials, and `nono why --host ...` only explains network-policy reachability. For command-policy denials, query the command edge directly:

```sh
nono why --profile <profile> --command gh -- issue comment 1052
nono profile show <profile>
nono profile validate <profile>
```

Look under `command_policies.commands.<command>.from.<caller>.invocation_policy` for argv or environment rules. For commands started directly by the sandboxed session, the caller is usually `session`; for a mediated command launched by another controlled command, the caller is the parent command name.

`invocation_policy` evaluates in this order: `deny`, then `approve`, then `allow`, then `default`. The `argv` matcher compares against the command arguments after the command name, so `gh issue comment 1052` matches `{"argv": {"prefix": ["issue", "comment"]}}`.

```json
{
  "command_policies": {
    "commands": {
      "gh": {
        "from": {
          "session": {
            "sandbox": {
              "fs_read": ["."],
              "network": {
                "allow_domain": ["api.github.com"]
              }
            },
            "invocation_policy": {
              "default": "deny",
              "deny": [
                {
                  "argv": { "prefix": ["issue", "comment"] },
                  "reason": "agents may read issues but not comment on them"
                }
              ],
              "allow": [
                {
                  "argv": { "prefix": ["issue", "list"] },
                  "reason": "agents may list GitHub issues"
                },
                {
                  "argv": { "prefix": ["issue", "view"] },
                  "reason": "agents may view GitHub issues"
                }
              ]
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

To allow a previously denied subcommand, remove or narrow the matching `deny` rule and add a matching `allow` rule, or change `default` if that is the intended policy. Adding a child-profile `allow` does not override an inherited `deny`. When profiles are merged, command policy permissions widen monotonically in most places, and an inherited `invocation_policy` on the same command edge is retained rather than replaced. If the resolved profile already contains the deny you want to remove, edit the profile that owns that rule or extend a base profile that does not include it.

#### Proxy credential endpoint policy

Some command policies intentionally use two layers:

1. `invocation_policy` blocks obvious high-level CLI mutations before the child process runs.
2. `sandbox.credentials[].endpoint_policy` blocks the underlying HTTP method and path even if the CLI uses a broad subcommand such as `gh api`.

If a command uses a proxy credential, both layers must allow the operation. For example, permitting `gh issue comment` at the argv layer is not enough if the GitHub API proxy still denies `POST /repos/<owner>/<repo>/issues/**`.

```json
{
  "command_policies": {
    "credentials": {
      "github-api": {
        "type": "proxy",
        "upstream": "https://api.github.com",
        "credential_key": "keyring://gh:github.com/example?decode=go-keyring",
        "env_var": "GH_TOKEN",
        "inject_header": "Authorization",
        "credential_format": "Bearer {}"
      }
    },
    "commands": {
      "gh": {
        "from": {
          "session": {
            "sandbox": {
              "credentials": [
                {
                  "name": "github-api",
                  "endpoint_policy": {
                    "default": "deny",
                    "allow": [
                      { "method": "GET", "path": "/repos/nolabs-ai/nono/issues" },
                      { "method": "GET", "path": "/repos/nolabs-ai/nono/issues/*" },
                      { "method": "POST", "path": "/repos/nolabs-ai/nono/issues/*/comments" }
                    ],
                    "deny": [
                      {
                        "method": "DELETE",
                        "path": "/**",
                        "reason": "destructive GitHub API calls are denied"
                      }
                    ]
                  }
                }
              ]
            },
            "invocation_policy": {
              "default": "deny",
              "allow": [
                { "argv": { "prefix": ["issue", "list"] } },
                { "argv": { "prefix": ["issue", "view"] } },
                { "argv": { "prefix": ["issue", "comment"] } },
                {
                  "argv": { "prefix": ["api"] },
                  "reason": "gh api is constrained by endpoint_policy"
                }
              ]
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Endpoint policy uses the same decision order as invocation policy: `deny`, then `approve`, then `allow`, then `default`. A broad `deny` such as `{"method": "POST", "path": "/repos/nolabs-ai/nono/issues/**"}` will still win over a later `allow` for issue comments. Remove or narrow the deny when the mutation is intentionally allowed.

### security

### filesystem

All filesystem grants, denials, and deny-rule exemptions live under this single section.

| Field               | Type            | Description |
|---------------------|-----------------|-------------|
| `allow`             | array of string | Directories with read+write access. Supports glob patterns (see below). |
| `read`              | array of string | Directories or files with read-only access. Supports glob patterns (see below). |
| `write`             | array of string | Directories with write-only access. Supports glob patterns (see below). |
| `allow_file`        | array of string | Single files with read+write access. |
| `read_file`         | array of string | Single files with read-only access. |
| `write_file`        | array of string | Single files with write-only access. |
| `unix_socket`       | array of string | Exact existing AF_UNIX socket paths, connect only. Implies read access. |
| `unix_socket_bind`  | array of string | Exact AF_UNIX socket paths, connect and bind. A future path implies read+write access on its parent directory. |
| `unix_socket_dir`   | array of string | Connect to direct-child sockets in a directory. Non-recursive. |
| `unix_socket_dir_bind` | array of string | Connect or bind direct-child sockets in a directory. Non-recursive. |
| `unix_socket_subtree` | array of string | Connect to descendant sockets recursively. |
| `unix_socket_subtree_bind` | array of string | Connect or bind descendant sockets recursively. |
| `deny`              | array of string | Paths denied filesystem access. Supports glob patterns (see below). |
| `bypass_protection` | array of string | Paths exempted from deny groups. **This flag does not implicitly grant access** — a matching filesystem or Unix socket field must also grant access. Supports glob patterns (see below). |
| `suppress_save_prompt` | array of string | Paths whose runtime denials should not be offered in save-profile prompts. Does not grant access or hide diagnostics. |

All path fields support variable expansion (see Section 6).

#### Glob patterns in path fields

`allow`, `read`, `write`, `deny`, and `bypass_protection` support `*` and `**` glob patterns:

| Pattern | Matches |
|---------|---------|
| `*` | Any filename within a single directory level. Does not cross `/`. Matches hidden files too — `src/*` matches `src/.env` the same as `src/index.js` (unlike a shell, which skips leading-dot names by default). |
| `**` | Zero or more path segments, including across directories. `foo/**` matches everything *inside* `foo/`, at any depth, but does **not** match `foo` itself — add a separate literal entry for `foo` if you need that too. |
| `**/<name>` | A file or directory named `<name>` at any depth, including at the root of the pattern. |

Patterns without an absolute prefix (e.g. `**/.env`) are rooted at the workdir. Patterns are expanded at sandbox start against the filesystem as it exists at that moment.

Basic example — grant read access to every `.json` config file directly under `config/`, without touching anything else in that directory:

```json
{
  "filesystem": {
    "read": ["$WORKDIR/config/*.json"]
  }
}
```

**Matching a directory grants everything inside it, recursively — regardless of `*` vs `**`.** The `*`/`**` distinction only controls what the *search* finds, not how much access a found directory grants. If `proj/*` matches a subdirectory `proj/sub`, that whole subdirectory becomes a normal recursive directory grant — the same as writing `"allow": ["proj/sub"]` directly — so everything under `sub`, at any depth, is included even though the pattern that found it only looked one level deep. To grant only specific files and exclude their siblings' subdirectories, target files by name/extension (`proj/*.json`) rather than matching the directory that contains them.

Only `*` and `**` are wildcards — every other character, including in real path segments the pattern happens to walk through (e.g. a directory literally named `[locale]`), is matched literally. `?` and character classes (`[abc]`) are rejected with a parse error rather than silently treated as wildcards.

**Symlinks**: a glob only ever matches entries whose real, resolved location stays inside the directory the pattern is rooted at. A symlink inside that directory pointing elsewhere on disk (e.g. `$WORKDIR/link -> ~/.ssh`) is skipped, and the pattern never follows it to grant access outside the intended root — even though a symlink pointing *within* the root still matches normally.

**Platform differences**:
- **macOS**: `filesystem.deny` glob patterns also emit a Seatbelt regex rule that enforces the deny at runtime, including for files created after the sandbox starts.
- **Linux**: glob patterns are expanded once at sandbox start. Files created after the sandbox starts are not covered.
- **Linux and `deny`-within-`allow`**: Landlock is strictly allow-list — it has no kernel-level "deny" primitive, so it cannot carve an exception out of a broader grant. If a `deny` pattern overlaps a path already covered by `allow`/`read`/`write` (e.g. `deny: ["$WORKDIR/src/.env"]` alongside `allow: ["$WORKDIR/src"]`), nono refuses to start on Linux rather than silently leave the deny unenforced. This is a hard error, not a warning — Seatbelt on macOS *can* express this and enforces it correctly, so the same profile behaves differently across platforms.

For a profile that works identically on both, write the `allow`/`read`/`write` patterns narrowly enough that they never match what you want denied, instead of granting broadly and subtracting after the fact:

```json
{
  "filesystem": {
    "read": ["$WORKDIR/src/**/*.ts", "$WORKDIR/src/**/*.tsx"],
    "deny": ["**/.env", "**/.secrets"]
  }
}
```

Here `read` only ever matches `.ts`/`.tsx` files, so it can never overlap `.env`/`.secrets` — the `deny` entries are a backstop that costs nothing on either platform, rather than a carve-out that only macOS can honor. If your files can't be filtered by a naming pattern, list the specific files/directories you need instead of granting their parent wholesale.

### workdir

| Field    | Type   | Default  | Description |
|----------|--------|----------|-------------|
| `access` | string | `"none"` | One of: `"none"`, `"read"`, `"write"`, `"readwrite"`. Controls automatic CWD sharing with the sandboxed process. |

### network

| Field                   | Type                              | Default  | Description |

| `block`                 | boolean                           | `false`  | Block all network access. |
| `allow_http2`           | boolean                           | `false`  | Allow HTTP/2 to upstream servers via ALPN negotiation. Default is HTTP/1.1 with keep-alive. Equivalent to `--allow-http2`. |
| `network_profile`       | string or null                    | inherit  | Name from `network-policy.json` for proxy filtering. Set to `null` to clear inherited value. |
| `allow_domain`          | array of string or object         | `[]`     | Additional domains to allow through the proxy. Entries can be plain strings (CONNECT tunnel) or objects with endpoint rules (TLS-intercepted L7 filtering). Supports wildcard subdomains (`*.googleapis.com`) and a whole-label wildcard in a non-leading position (`jenkins.*.ci.example.com`, matching exactly one label there). |
| `deny_domain`           | array of string                   | `[]`     | Domains to block through the proxy regardless of the allowlist. Evaluated before `allow_domain`. Supports the same wildcard grammar as `allow_domain` (`*.ads.example.com`, `jenkins.*.ci.example.com`). Equivalent to `--deny-domain`. |
| `credentials`           | array of string                   | `[]`     | Credential services to enable via reverse proxy. |
| `open_port`             | array of integer                  | `[]`     | Localhost TCP IPC (connect + bind). Port **0**: macOS only (`localhost:*` outbound); Linux: explicit ports. |
| `open_port_range`       | array of `[start, end]`           | `[]`     | Inclusive port ranges for bidirectional localhost TCP (connect + bind). Multiple ranges are supported. Example: `[[3000, 3010], [8000, 8100]]`. Each port becomes an individual rule; overlapping ranges are merged automatically. **macOS**: hard limit of 16,384 unique ports across all ranges (2¹⁴) due to `sandbox_init` rule limits. **Linux**: no limit beyond the 16-bit port space (1–65535). |
| `listen_port`           | array of integer                  | `[]`     | TCP ports the sandboxed child may listen on (bind only). |
| `listen_port_range`     | array of `[start, end]`           | `[]`     | Inclusive port ranges for TCP listen (bind only). Multiple ranges are supported. Example: `[[8000, 8100], [9000, 9010]]`. Overlapping ranges are merged automatically. Same platform limits as `open_port_range`. |
| `no_proxy`              | array of string                   | `[]`     | Additional client-side `NO_PROXY` / `no_proxy` entries in proxy mode. This does not grant network access; direct connections still require matching sandbox permissions. Entries must be host patterns only (safe single-label local alias, canonical IP literal, `*.` wildcard suffix, or leading-dot suffix); bare multi-label domains, protected metadata suffix tokens, URLs, credentials, ports, paths, comma-separated lists, and `*` are rejected. |
| `custom_credentials`    | map of string to credential def   | `{}`     | Custom credential route definitions (see below). Defines the route only — the proxy does not activate unless the service name also appears in `credentials`. |
| `upstream_proxy`        | string                            | `null`   | Enterprise proxy address (`host:port`). |
| `upstream_bypass`       | array of string                   | `[]`     | Hosts to bypass the upstream proxy. Supports `*.` wildcard suffixes. |

#### Hostname wildcard patterns

`allow_domain`, `deny_domain`, and `custom_credentials.<name>.upstream` all share one hostname matcher, so a host that reaches the proxy is authorized and routed by the same rule:

| Pattern | Matches |
|---------|---------|
| `*.example.com` | One or more labels under `example.com` — `api.example.com` and `a.b.example.com` both match, but not `example.com` itself. |
| `jenkins.*.ci.example.com` | Exactly one label in the `*` position — `jenkins.prod.ci.example.com` matches; `jenkins.ci.example.com` (zero labels) and `jenkins.a.b.ci.example.com` (two labels) do not. |

A `*` occupying only part of a label (`jenkins-*.example.com`) is not a wildcard and can never match, since a real hostname label never contains `*`.

#### allow_domain with endpoint restrictions

When an `allow_domain` entry is an object with `endpoints`, the proxy performs TLS interception to enforce method+path restrictions (default-deny). This is useful for restricting access to specific API endpoints without credential injection:

```json
{
  "network": {
    "allow_domain": [
      "api.openai.com",
      {
        "domain": "api.github.com",
        "endpoints": [
          { "method": "GET", "path": "/repos/my-org/**" },
          { "method": "POST", "path": "/repos/my-org/*/issues" }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

| Field       | Type   | Required | Description |
|-------------|--------|----------|-------------|
| `domain`    | string | yes      | Domain hostname (e.g., `"api.github.com"`). |
| `endpoints` | array  | yes      | L7 method+path rules. Only requests matching at least one rule are allowed. |

Each endpoint rule has `method` (HTTP method or `"*"` for any) and `path` (glob pattern: `*` = one segment, `**` = zero or more segments).

When profiles extend each other, endpoint rules for the same domain are **appended** (merged), not replaced. Proxy mode is automatically enabled when endpoint rules are present.

#### custom_credentials entry

Define a custom reverse proxy credential route for services not in `network-policy.json`.

> **Important:** `custom_credentials` defines the route configuration but does not activate the proxy on its own. The service name must also appear in `credentials` to start the proxy and inject the phantom token. For example:
>
> ```json
> {
>   "network": {
>     "credentials": ["myservice"],
>     "custom_credentials": {
>       "myservice": {
>         "upstream": "https://api.myservice.com",
>         "credential_key": "myservice_api_key",
>         "inject_header": "Authorization",
>         "credential_format": "Bearer {}"
>       }
>     }
>   }
> }
> ```

An individual entry in the `custom_credentials` map is configured as follows:

```json
{
  "upstream": "https://api.example.com",
  "credential_key": "example_api_key",
  "inject_mode": "header",
  "inject_header": "Authorization",
  "credential_format": "Bearer {}",
  "proxy": {
    "inject_mode": "query_param",
    "query_param_name": "api_key"
  }
}
```

| Field               | Type            | Required    | Description |
|---------------------|-----------------|-------------|-------------|
| `upstream`          | string          | yes         | Upstream URL. Must be HTTPS (HTTP only for loopback). |
| `credential_key`    | string          | yes         | Keystore account name, `op://` URI, `bw://` URI, `apple-password://` URI, `keyring://` URI, `file://` URI, `env://` URI, or `cmd://` URI referencing `credential_capture`. |
| `inject_mode`       | string          | no          | One of: `"header"` (default), `"url_path"`, `"query_param"`, `"basic_auth"`. |
| `inject_header`     | string          | header mode | HTTP header name. Default: `"Authorization"`. |
| `credential_format` | string          | header mode | Format string with `{}` placeholder. Default: `"Bearer {}"`. |
| `path_pattern`      | string          | url_path    | Pattern to match in URL path. Use `{}` for placeholder. |
| `path_replacement`  | string          | url_path    | Replacement pattern. Defaults to `path_pattern`. |
| `query_param_name`  | string          | query_param | Query parameter name for credential injection. |
| `proxy`             | object          | no          | Optional proxy-side overrides for phantom token parsing. Omitted fields inherit from top-level values. |
| `env_var`           | string          | URI keys    | Environment variable name for SDK API key. Required when `credential_key` is `op://`, `bw://`, `apple-password://`, `keyring://`, `file://`, or `cmd://`. Optional for `env://`. |
| `endpoint_rules`    | array           | no          | L7 allow-list of `{"method": "GET", "path": "/**"}` rules. When non-empty, only matching requests are forwarded (default-deny). |
| `tls_ca`            | string (path)   | no          | Path to a PEM-encoded CA certificate. Use for upstreams with self-signed or private CA certs (e.g. a Kubernetes API server). |
| `tls_client_cert`   | string (path)   | no          | Path to a PEM-encoded client certificate for mutual TLS (mTLS). Must be set together with `tls_client_key`. |
| `tls_client_key`    | string (path)   | no          | Path to the PEM-encoded private key matching `tls_client_cert`. |

`proxy` overrides apply only to how the local proxy validates incoming phantom tokens from the sandboxed process. Outbound upstream credential injection continues to use top-level fields.

### credential_capture

Defines supervisor-side commands and provider subprocesses that produce credentials for `cmd://` custom credential routes. Capture runs lazily when the proxy first needs the credential; only the proxy receives captured material, and the sandboxed child never sees the command output, provider output, or real credential.

```json
{
  "network": {
    "credentials": ["github"],
    "custom_credentials": {
      "github": {
        "upstream": "https://api.github.com",
        "credential_key": "cmd://github",
        "env_var": "GH_TOKEN",
        "credential_format": "token {}"
      }
    }
  },
  "credential_capture": {
    "github": {
      "command": ["gh", "auth", "token"],
      "timeout_secs": 5,
      "cache_ttl_secs": 900,
      "cache_path_regex": "^/(?:repos/|orgs/)?([^/]+)"
    }
  }
}
```

Provider-backed captures use a typed JSON protocol. The provider receives request metadata and provider-specific config on stdin and returns credential material on stdout. The provider does not route requests or inject credentials; `nono` still validates the phantom token, applies endpoint policy, validates provider output, and injects only on matching upstream requests.

```json
{
  "network": {
    "credentials": ["acme_mcp"],
    "custom_credentials": {
      "acme_mcp": {
        "upstream": "https://mcp.acme.com",
        "credential_key": "cmd://acme_mcp",
        "env_var": "ACME_MCP_TOKEN",
        "credential_format": "Bearer {}",
        "endpoint_rules": [{ "method": "*", "path": "/mcp/**" }]
      }
    }
  },
  "credential_capture": {
    "acme_mcp": {
      "provider": {
        "command": ["acme-nono-provider"],
        "config": {
          "issuer": "https://auth.acme.com",
          "client_id": "abc123"
        }
      },
      "timeout_secs": 30,
      "cache_ttl_secs": 240
    }
  }
}
```

Provider stdout must be JSON:

```json
{
  "material": {
    "type": "secret",
    "value": "real-access-token"
  }
}
```

For multi-header output, configure `output.allow_headers` and return:

```json
{
  "material": {
    "type": "headers",
    "headers": {
      "Authorization": "Bearer real-access-token"
    }
  }
}
```

| Field              | Type            | Required | Default | Description |
|--------------------|-----------------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `command`          | array of string | yes      | —       | Command and arguments. No shell interpolation is used. |
| `timeout_secs`     | integer         | no       | `5`     | Maximum runtime, 1–300 seconds. |
| `cache_ttl_secs`   | integer         | no       | `900`   | In-memory cache TTL, 0–3600 seconds. `0` disables caching. |
| `ttl_secs`         | integer         | no       | `900`   | Older alias for `cache_ttl_secs`. Do not set both fields. |
| `cache_path_regex` | string          | no       | host    | Regex evaluated against the request path. Capture group 1 becomes the cache scope; otherwise the full match is used. |
| `stdin`            | string          | no       | `null`  | `null` closes stdin (unless `interaction.stdin` is `true`); `request_json` writes request metadata JSON to stdin. |
| `output`           | string/object   | no       | `text`  | `text` captures stdout as one credential. `{"format":"json","allow_headers":[...]}` captures multiple headers. |
| `interaction`      | object          | no       | none    | Explicit opt-in for capture commands that need inherited stderr, inherited stdin, or browser opening. |

Capture commands run with `NONO_SESSION_ID`, `NONO_REQUEST_HOST`, `NONO_REQUEST_PATH`, `NONO_REQUEST_METHOD`, `NONO_CACHE_SCOPE`, `NONO_CAPTURE_CREDENTIAL`, and `NONO_CAPTURE_ROUTE` set. Proxy environment variables are removed to avoid recursively using the same proxy route while capturing the credential.

`stdin: "request_json"` sends this shape to the command:

```json
{
  "session_id": "c0ffee1234567890",
  "credential_name": "github",
  "route_id": "github",
  "request_host": "api.github.com",
  "request_path": "/repos/nolabs-ai/nono/issues/787",
  "request_method": "GET",
  "cache_scope": "nolabs-ai"
}
```

For multi-header injection, use object-form output and allow every header name explicitly:

```json
{
  "credential_capture": {
    "gateway": {
      "command": ["internal-auth", "headers"],
      "output": {
        "format": "json",
        "allow_headers": ["Authorization", "X-Gateway-Key"]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The command must print JSON like `{"headers":{"Authorization":"Bearer ...","X-Gateway-Key":"..."}}`. The proxy rejects empty output, unlisted headers, hop-by-hop headers, invalid header names, non-string values, and values containing CR or LF. Audit records include the route, command path, redacted argv, duration, exit status, cache state, cache scope, output format, header names, stdin mode, interaction flag, stdout byte count, and redacted stderr for failures; credential values are never logged.

Browser auth is command-scoped. Add `interaction.open_urls` to a specific capture entry when that command may open a browser:

```json
{
  "credential_capture": {
    "github": {
      "command": ["gh", "auth", "login"],
      "interaction": {
        "stdio": true,
        "open_urls": {
          "allow_origins": ["https://github.com"],
          "allow_localhost": true
        },
        "allow_launch_services": true
      }
    }
  }
}
```

When `open_urls` is configured, nono gives the capture command a temporary `BROWSER` helper and URL-opening socket. On macOS it also prepends an `open` shim to `PATH`. URL requests through those helpers are validated against that capture entry's `interaction.open_urls`, not the command sandbox's top-level `open_urls`. Non-URL `open` fallback through the shim is available only when `allow_launch_services` is true.

### credential_providers and credential_routes

`credential_providers` declare profile-driven OAuth providers for sandboxed `/login` flows where the agent may drive the CLI, but token endpoint responses are captured and rewritten before real token material reaches the sandbox. The sandbox receives phantom `nono_<64hex>` tokens; the proxy resolves those phantoms to real tokens only for declared `api_hosts` and route endpoint policy.

`credential_routes` bind a provider to the sandbox-visible environment variables and optional API endpoint policy. Provider declarations are data, so local profiles and packs can define providers without adding Rust enum variants or merging provider-specific code.

OAuth capture currently forces HTTP/1.1 for declared token hosts so the proxy can buffer and rewrite token responses before releasing them to the sandbox. HTTP/2 token response rewriting must be implemented before capture hosts can safely negotiate h2.

When a client has its own CA-bundle environment variable, add it with
`network.tls_intercept.ca_env_vars`. nono still sets the standard CA variables;
profile entries add client-specific names that should point at the same
generated trust bundle.

```json
{
  "network": {
    "tls_intercept": {
      "ca_env_vars": ["CODEX_CA_CERTIFICATE"]
    }
  },
  "credential_providers": {
    "claude_code": {

        }
      ],

      "credential_store": {
        "type": "keychain_json",
        "service": "Claude Code-credentials",
        "account_candidates": ["unknown", "$USER", "claude-code-user"],
        "phantom_fields": [
          "claudeAiOauth.accessToken",
          "claudeAiOauth.refreshToken"
        ]
      },
      "helpers": {
        "status": ["claude", "auth", "status", "--json"],
        "login": ["claude", "auth", "login"],
        "logout": ["claude", "auth", "logout"]
      }
    }
  },
  "credential_routes": [

```

| Provider field       | Type            | Required | Description |
|----------------------|-----------------|----------|-------------|
| `type`               | string          | yes      | Currently `oauth_capture`. |
| `token_endpoints`    | array           | yes      | HTTPS OAuth token origins and exact paths whose JSON responses are captured and rewritten to phantom tokens. Configure every token-bearing path the client may use. |
| `api_hosts`          | array           | yes      | HTTPS API URL origins where this provider's phantom tokens may be resolved on egress. |
| `response_fields`    | array           | yes      | Token response fields to rewrite. Each entry declares a `path` and a visible phantom `kind` of `opaque` or `jwt`; use `jwt` only for locally parsed fields, not bearer tokens resent upstream. An optional `format` (e.g. `"sk-ant-oat01-{}"`, `kind: opaque` only) shapes the visible phantom — `{}` is a random body — so a client that classifies a credential by its literal prefix recognises it; the template is stripped on egress. |
| `request_body`       | string          | no       | Token request body format for refresh/exchange rewriting: `auto`, `json`, or `form`. |
| `credential_store`   | object          | no       | Optional session/logout detection, such as a keychain JSON record or file JSON record with fields expected to contain phantoms. |
| `helpers`            | object          | no       | Optional status, login, and logout commands for humans or CLI workflows. Commands are arrays and are not run through a shell. |

The OAuth capture store lives under nono's state directory with owner-only
permissions. It retains real token material for phantom resolution for up to 90
days, capped at 4096 phantoms.

Unmatched capture-host responses are inspected for common OAuth token field
names as a fail-closed backstop. Providers that use unusual token field names
still need exact `token_endpoints` and exhaustive `response_fields`; the backstop
is not the primary capture policy.

| Route field          | Type            | Required | Description |
|----------------------|-----------------|----------|-------------|
| `name`               | string          | yes      | Route name used in generated proxy routes and audit. |
| `provider`           | string          | yes      | Provider key from `credential_providers`. |
| `env_var`            | string          | no       | Optional environment variable for clients that can start from a sandbox-visible phantom. Many OAuth CLI clients instead receive phantoms by writing their captured credential store during login. |
| `base_url_env_var`   | string          | no       | Environment variable that points SDKs or CLIs at the mediated proxy base URL. |
| `endpoint_policy`    | object          | no       | Method/path policy for provider API egress. |

### env_credentials

Maps keystore account names to environment variable names. Secrets are loaded from the system keystore (macOS Keychain / Linux Secret Service) under the service name "nono".

```json
{
  "env_credentials": {
    "openai_api_key": "OPENAI_API_KEY",
    "op://vault/item/field": "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY"
  }
}
```

Supported key formats:
- Bare keystore account name: `"openai_api_key"`
- 1Password URI: `"op://vault/item/field"`
- Apple Passwords URI: `"apple-password://account/name"`
- Environment reference: `"env://EXISTING_VAR"`

### environment

Controls which environment variables are passed to the sandboxed process. When `allow_vars` is set, only the listed variables (and nono-injected credentials) are passed through. `set_vars` injects explicit values regardless of filtering.

```json
{
  "environment": {
    "allow_vars": ["*"],
    "deny_vars": ["*TOKEN*", "*KEY*", "*SECRET*"],
    "case_insensitive_vars": true,
    "set_vars": { "RUST_LOG": "debug", "XDG_CONFIG_HOME": "$HOME/.config" }
  }
}
```

| Field                   | Type            | Default | Description |
|-------------------------|-----------------|---------|-------------|
| `allow_vars`            | array of string | absent  | Allow-list of environment variable names. Supports exact names (`"PATH"`) and glob patterns where `*` may appear anywhere in the name — leading, trailing, or infix (`"AWS_*"`, `"*_TOKEN"`, `"*SECRET*"`, `"AWS_*_TOKEN"`). A bare `"*"` matches everything. When omitted (or when the `environment` section is absent entirely), all variables pass through. When explicitly set to `[]`, no inherited variables are passed (only nono-injected credentials). When non-empty, only matching variables pass. Nono-injected credentials always bypass this list. |
| `deny_vars`             | array of string | `[]`    | Deny-list of environment variable names stripped from the child. Same glob syntax as `allow_vars`. Denied vars are stripped even if they also match `allow_vars`. |
| `case_insensitive_vars` | boolean         | `false` | When `true`, `allow_vars`/`deny_vars` patterns are matched case-insensitively, so `"*token*"` also matches `JENKINS_TOKEN`, `jenkins_token`, and `Jenkins_Token`. |
| `set_vars`              | object (string→string) | `{}` | Static environment variables injected after allow/deny filtering and before credential injection (injected credentials win on conflict). Values support the same expansion as profile paths (`$HOME`, `~`, `$WORKDIR`, `$TMPDIR`, `$XDG_*`, `$NONO_CONFIG`, `$NONO_PACKAGES`); keys are not expanded. `PATH` and any `NONO_*` key are reserved and rejected at load time. Unlike inherited host vars, keys here are NOT subject to the dangerous-variable blocklist (`LD_PRELOAD`, `NODE_OPTIONS`, …) — setting one is an explicit operator decision. |

Matching is always anchored to the full variable name — a pattern never matches a substring implicitly unless it uses `*` to say so.

Inheritance: child `allow_vars` and `deny_vars` are appended to base values and deduplicated; `case_insensitive_vars` is sticky (once any profile in the chain sets it `true`, a child cannot revert it to `false`); `set_vars` merges as a map, with the child's value winning on key conflict.

### export_env (caller-declared environment pass-through)

`export_env` lets a **caller** declare which of its own live environment variables flow down, verbatim, to the commands it invokes — bypassing both the callee's `allow_vars` filtering and the built-in dangerous-variable blocklist (`LD_PRELOAD`, `NODE_OPTIONS`, `PYTHONPATH`, …). It is the escape hatch for tools that must forward an interpreter/tooling variable to the programs they launch (for example an interpreter-injection variable a wrapper sets before spawning a child interpreter).

This is a **caller-declared** control: the field lives on the command doing the invoking (or on the session, for the top-level case), not on the command being invoked. When a command is intercepted, nono attributes it to its resolved caller, then copies the matching variables from that intercepted command's **immediate-parent environment** into the child. The caller's list is only the filter; the values always come from the live parent environment.

- **Patterns:** exact names (`"TOOL_CONFIG"`) or a glob with a single `*` anywhere in the name (`"AWS_*"`, `"*_TOKEN"`, `"AWS_*_TOKEN"`), or a bare `"*"` (all). A pattern with more than one `*` (e.g. `"A**B"`) is rejected at load time.
- **`PATH` and any `NONO_*` key are always excluded** — nono manages those — even under `"*"`. A pattern that explicitly targets them (exact `PATH`, or the `NONO_` prefix) is rejected at load time.
- Values are taken verbatim and are **not** run through the credential broker. Use `export_env` for tooling variables, not credentials — those flow through `use_credentials`/`allow_vars`.
- Applied on both the macOS and Linux command-mediation paths, before PATH/chaining/`set_vars`/credential injection, so nono-injected variables still win. Merges by dedup-append across the inheritance chain.

#### Per-command caller: `commands.<caller>.export_env`

When the invoking command is itself mediated, declare `export_env` on that command. Example: `git` runs a hook that spawns `node`; `node`'s resolved caller is `git`, so `git`'s `export_env` decides what reaches `node`:

```json
{
  "command_policies": {
    "commands": {
      "git": {
        "can_use": ["node"],
        "export_env": ["TOOL_CONFIG"]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Session caller: `session_export_env`

When the intercepted command's nearest mediated ancestor is the session itself — for example an **unmediated** wrapper spawns it, so the ancestry walk reaches the session root without crossing a mediated command — its caller is the session. Declare the top-level `session_export_env` to cover this case:

```json
{
  "command_policies": {
    "session_export_env": ["TOOL_CONFIG"],
    "commands": {
      "node": {
        "from": { "session": { "fs_read": ["."] } }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Here an unmediated wrapper invokes `node` while holding `TOOL_CONFIG` in its environment; `node`'s caller resolves to the session, so `session_export_env` copies `TOOL_CONFIG` into `node` verbatim.

### hooks

Map of application name to hook configuration:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "claude-code": {
      "event": "PostToolUseFailure",
      "matcher": "Read|Write|Edit|Bash",
      "script": "nono-hook.sh"
    }
  }
}
```

| Field     | Type   | Description |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| `event`   | string | Trigger event name. |
| `matcher` | string | Regex for tool name matching. |
| `script`  | string | Script filename from embedded hooks. |

### rollback

| Field              | Type            | Description |
|--------------------|-----------------|-------------|
| `exclude_patterns` | array of string | Path component patterns to exclude from snapshots. |
| `exclude_globs`    | array of string | Glob patterns for filename exclusion. |

### open_urls

Controls supervisor-delegated URL opening (e.g., OAuth2 login flows).

| Field             | Type            | Default | Description |
|-------------------|-----------------|---------|-------------|
| `allow_origins`   | array of string | `[]`    | Allowed URL origins (scheme + host, e.g., `"https://console.anthropic.com"`). |
| `allow_localhost`  | boolean         | `false` | Allow `http://localhost` and `http://127.0.0.1` URLs. |

To replace inherited URL-opening permissions, provide `open_urls` with an explicit empty object: `"open_urls": { "allow_origins": [], "allow_localhost": false }`. Omitting `open_urls` inherits the base profile's configuration.

## 4. Common Patterns

### Developer profile (extending default)

```json
{
  "extends": "default",
  "meta": {
    "name": "developer",
    "description": "General development"
  },
  "workdir": {
    "access": "readwrite"
  },
  "filesystem": {
    "read": ["$HOME/.config"]
  }
}
```

### CI profile (locked down)

```json
{
  "meta": {
    "name": "ci-build",
    "description": "CI build environment"
  },
  "groups": {
    "include": ["deny_credentials", "deny_ssh_keys"]
  },
  "workdir": {
    "access": "readwrite"
  },
  "network": {
    "block": true
  }
}
```

### Agent with API access

```json
{
  "extends": "default",
  "meta": {
    "name": "api-agent",
    "description": "Agent with API access"
  },
  "workdir": {
    "access": "readwrite"
  },
  "env_credentials": {
    "openai_api_key": "OPENAI_API_KEY"
  },
  "network": {
    "network_profile": "standard"
  }
}
```

### Linux host compatibility

On Linux, the built-in `default` profile keeps host runtime, sysfs, and shared temp reads out of the base policy. If your tool needs access to paths like `/run`, `/var/run`, `/sys`, or `/tmp`, extend the built-in compatibility preset:

```json
{
  "extends": "linux-host-compat",
  "meta": {
    "name": "linux-desktop-agent",
    "description": "Agent with Linux host runtime compatibility"
  },
  "workdir": {
    "access": "readwrite"
  }
}
```

### Profile with deny overrides

When a deny group blocks a path you need access to, use `filesystem.bypass_protection` together with an explicit filesystem or Unix socket grant. Remember: `bypass_protection` only removes the deny rule — it does not grant access on its own.

```json
{
  "extends": "default",
  "meta": {
    "name": "shell-config-reader",
    "description": "Needs to read shell configs"
  },
  "workdir": {
    "access": "readwrite"
  },
  "filesystem": {
    "read_file": ["$HOME/.bashrc", "$HOME/.zshrc"],
    "bypass_protection": ["$HOME/.bashrc", "$HOME/.zshrc"]
  }
}
```

### Suppress repeated save suggestions

Use `filesystem.suppress_save_prompt` for paths you intentionally do not want
to grant, but also do not want offered in the save-profile prompt every run:

```json
{
  "extends": "default",
  "meta": {
    "name": "copilot-local",
    "description": "Local prompt-suppression choices"
  },
  "filesystem": {
    "suppress_save_prompt": ["$HOME/.copilot/settings.json"]
  }
}
```

The sandbox still denies these paths. `filesystem.suppress_save_prompt` only
filters the save-profile suggestion; the explicit suppress name makes clear
it is not an access grant.

### Protected nono state roots

nono always protects its own state from sandboxed children. The protected roots
are:

- `$HOME/.nono`, the legacy state location retained for compatibility.
- `$XDG_STATE_HOME/nono`, the current state location. When
  `XDG_STATE_HOME` is unset, this is `$HOME/.local/state/nono`.

Neither root, nor any path below either root, can be granted in a profile or
through CLI filesystem flags. A directory grant that contains a protected root
(for example `$HOME` or `$HOME/.local`) is also rejected by default, because
it would expose nono state.

Protected-root denials remain visible in post-run diagnostics and audit output,
but nono does not offer them in the post-run save-profile prompt. They cannot
be saved as filesystem grants, `filesystem.bypass_protection`, or
`filesystem.suppress_save_prompt` entries.

### Denying specific project files

Block access to a file in the working directory while keeping the rest accessible. Use `$WORKDIR` to reference the current working directory — relative paths like `./` are not expanded:

```json
{
  "extends": "claude-code",
  "meta": {
    "name": "no-dotenv",
    "description": "Claude Code without .env access"
  },
  "filesystem": {
    "deny": ["$WORKDIR/.env"]
  }
}
```

**macOS**: This works directly. Seatbelt can deny a specific file within an allowed directory.

**Linux**: Landlock is strictly allow-list and cannot deny a child of an allowed parent. Use supervised mode instead, which intercepts file opens via seccomp-notify and checks them against the deny list before granting access:

```json
{
  "extends": "claude-code",
  "meta": {
    "name": "no-dotenv",
    "description": "Claude Code without .env access"
  },
  "security": {
    "capability_elevation": true
  },
  "filesystem": {
    "deny": ["$WORKDIR/.env"]
  }
}
```

With `capability_elevation` enabled, nono runs in supervised mode where every file access outside the initial grant set is trapped and evaluated. The deny list is checked before the supervisor prompts for approval, so denied paths are blocked regardless of platform.

### Blocking container access (Docker, Podman, kubectl)

Socket access enforcement is platform-specific because macOS (Seatbelt) and Linux (Landlock + seccomp) have different capabilities.

#### macOS

Use `filesystem.deny` on the socket path. Seatbelt treats `connect(2)` as a network operation, so nono also emits a `network-outbound` deny for the path — the socket is blocked at both the filesystem and network layers:

```json
{
  "extends": "claude-code",
  "meta": {
    "name": "no-docker",
    "description": "Claude Code without Docker access"
  },
  "filesystem": {
    "deny": ["/var/run/docker.sock"]
  }
}
```

Denying a directory blocks socket connections recursively below it. To reopen
one existing socket, pair an exact `unix_socket` entry with the same exact
`bypass_protection` path; sibling sockets remain denied. Directory socket
grants preserve their scope when bypassed: `unix_socket_dir` remains
direct-child-only and `unix_socket_subtree` remains recursive.

Creating a new exact socket with `unix_socket_bind` requires write access to
its parent directory. If that parent is denied, bypass the parent directory or,
preferably, use `unix_socket_dir_bind` with a dedicated directory.

#### Linux

Landlock cannot express deny-within-allow, so `filesystem.deny` is a no-op on Linux. Instead, enable `linux.af_unix_mediation` to switch to a default-deny seccomp supervisor for AF_UNIX pathname sockets, then add back only the sockets the agent needs via `filesystem.unix_socket`:

```json
{
  "extends": "claude-code",
  "meta": {
    "name": "no-docker",
    "description": "Claude Code without Docker access"
  },
  "linux": {
    "af_unix_mediation": "pathname"
  }
}
```

With no `filesystem.unix_socket` entries, every AF_UNIX pathname connect and bind is blocked — including `/run/docker.sock`. To allow specific sockets back (e.g. tmux, D-Bus), add them explicitly:

```json
{
  "linux": { "af_unix_mediation": "pathname" },
  "filesystem": {
    "unix_socket": ["/run/user/1000/bus"]
  }
}
```

#### Deprecation note

`commands.deny` is deprecated startup-only gating — it blocks the command from launching but does not enforce socket access and should not be relied on as enforcement. It remains visible in `nono profile show` under the commands section for compatibility.

### Allowing parent-of-protected-root grants (macOS only)

By default, granting a parent directory of a protected root (for example
`--allow ~` or `--read ~/.local`) is rejected because it would expose nono's
internal state. On macOS, Seatbelt can express deny-within-allow rules, so this
restriction can be relaxed when the profile opts in with
`allow_parent_of_protected`:

```json
{
  "extends": "claude-code",
  "meta": {
    "name": "home-access",
    "description": "Claude Code with full home directory access"
  },
  "allow_parent_of_protected": true
}
```

When `allow_parent_of_protected` is `true` and the platform is macOS, nono
permits the parent grant and emits Seatbelt deny rules that continue to protect
both `$HOME/.nono` and `$XDG_STATE_HOME/nono` from reads and writes. For
example, this can permit access to ordinary files under `$HOME/.local` while
still denying `$HOME/.local/state/nono` when the default XDG state location is
used. This setting does not grant access to either protected root itself.

On Linux this field is ignored — Landlock cannot deny a child of an allowed
parent, so the pre-flight check always rejects parent-of-protected grants.

### Profile with group exclusion

Remove an inherited deny group that is too restrictive for your use case:

```json
{
  "extends": "default",
  "meta": {
    "name": "browser-tool",
    "description": "Needs browser data access"
  },
  "workdir": {
    "access": "readwrite"
  },
  "groups": {
    "exclude": ["deny_browser_data_macos", "deny_browser_data_linux"]
  }
}
```

### Profile with custom credential routing

```json
{
  "extends": "default",
  "meta": {
    "name": "telegram-bot",
    "description": "Telegram bot with credential injection"
  },
  "workdir": {
    "access": "readwrite"
  },
  "network": {
    "custom_credentials": {
      "telegram": {
        "upstream": "https://api.telegram.org",
        "credential_key": "telegram_bot_token",
        "inject_mode": "url_path",
        "path_pattern": "/bot{}/",
        "path_replacement": "/bot{}/"
      }
    },
    "credentials": ["telegram"]
  }
}
```

## 5. Validation

Run these commands to verify a profile:

```
nono profile validate <path>      # Check a profile file for errors
nono profile show <name>          # Show the fully resolved profile (after inheritance)
nono profile groups               # List available security groups
nono profile diff <a> <b>         # Compare two profiles
```

## 6. Profile Drafts

Profile drafts are a staging area for creating or editing profiles before they are applied. Drafts live in `~/.config/nono/profile-drafts/` (or `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/nono/profile-drafts/`). The live profiles directory (`~/.config/nono/profiles/`) is read-only inside a running agent sandbox by default, so the draft workflow is the correct way for an agent to propose profile changes.

**Note:** this default only holds if the sandbox's capability grants don't cover `~/.config/nono/profiles/`. Granting write access to an ancestor directory — `~/.config`, `$HOME`, or any parent of the profiles path — extends that access to the profiles directory too, since it is not currently designated as a protected state root (unlike `~/.nono` and `$XDG_STATE_HOME/nono`, which nono's `ProtectedRoots` mechanism rejects grants against). The same ancestor grant also exposes other sensitive files under `~/.config/nono/`, including `config.toml` and `packages/` (installed pack manifests, hooks, and skills). Scope `--allow` grants as narrowly as possible (e.g. to the specific config subdirectory an agent actually needs) to avoid inadvertently making these paths writable.

### Creating a new profile via draft

Write the profile JSON to the drafts directory using the profile name as the filename:

```
~/.config/nono/profile-drafts/my-agent.json
```

The `meta.name` field inside the JSON must match the filename (without `.json`). Then validate and promote:

```
nono profile validate --draft my-agent   # Validate the draft before promoting
nono profile promote my-agent            # Show diff and prompt for confirmation
nono profile promote --diff my-agent     # Preview the diff without applying
nono profile promote --yes my-agent      # Apply without interactive confirmation
```

On success, `promote` atomically writes the profile to `~/.config/nono/profiles/my-agent.json` and deletes the draft file.

### Editing an existing profile via draft

When drafting a change to a profile that already exists, you must also create a `.base` file alongside the draft JSON. The `.base` file contains the SHA-256 hex digest of the current profile bytes. `promote` checks this hash to detect if the live profile changed while the draft was in progress.

Steps:

1. Read the current profile: `~/.config/nono/profiles/my-agent.json`
2. Compute its SHA-256 hex digest and write it to `~/.config/nono/profile-drafts/my-agent.base`
3. Write your modified profile JSON to `~/.config/nono/profile-drafts/my-agent.json`
4. Validate and promote:

```
nono profile validate --draft my-agent
nono profile promote my-agent
```

The `.base` file must contain exactly 64 lowercase hex characters. If the live profile was modified after the draft was created and the hash no longer matches, `promote` exits with:

```
draft base hash does not match current profile. The profile changed after the draft was written; regenerate or review the draft before promoting.
```

Reread the current profile, recompute the hash, and update your draft.

### Extending a built-in or pack profile

`promote` refuses to replace a built-in or pack-installed profile. Instead, draft a derived profile that extends it:

```json
{
  "meta": { "name": "default-local", "version": "1", "description": "My customisations" },
  "extends": "default"
}
```

Draft name: `~/.config/nono/profile-drafts/default-local.json` (no `.base` needed — this is a new profile).

Then start sessions with `nono run --profile default-local -- <command>`.

### Summary of draft files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `~/.config/nono/profile-drafts/<name>.json` | Draft profile JSON |
| `~/.config/nono/profile-drafts/<name>.base` | SHA-256 of live profile at draft creation time (required only when editing an existing profile) |

## 7. Variable Expansion

The following variables are expanded in all path fields (`filesystem.*`, including `filesystem.allow`, `filesystem.read`, `filesystem.write`, `filesystem.deny`, `filesystem.bypass_protection`, and `filesystem.suppress_save_prompt`), in `command_args`, and in the values of `environment.set_vars`.

| Variable           | Expands to |
|--------------------|------------|
| `$HOME`            | User's home directory |
| `$WORKDIR`         | Working directory (from `--workdir` flag or cwd) |
| `$TMPDIR`          | System temporary directory |
| `$UID`             | Current user ID |
| `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` | XDG config directory (default: `$HOME/.config`) |
| `$XDG_DATA_HOME`   | XDG data directory (default: `$HOME/.local/share`) |
| `$XDG_STATE_HOME`  | XDG state directory (default: `$HOME/.local/state`) |
| `$XDG_CACHE_HOME`  | XDG cache directory (default: `$HOME/.cache`) |
| `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` | XDG runtime directory (no default; left unexpanded when unset) |

Always use these variables instead of hardcoded absolute paths to keep profiles portable across machines and users.

## 8. Platform Predicates

Profile entries that list paths, group names, URL origins, or env credentials can be unconditional strings or conditional objects with `when`.

```json
{
  "groups": {
    "include": [
      "agent_common",
      { "name": "agent_linux", "when": "linux" },
      { "name": "agent_macos", "when": "macos" }
    ]
  },
  "filesystem": {
    "read": [
      "$HOME/.agent",
      { "path": "$HOME/Library/Application Support/Agent", "when": "macos" },
      { "path": "$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/agent", "when": "linux" }
    ]
  },
  "env_credentials": {
    "agent_key": { "env_var": "AGENT_API_KEY", "when": ["linux", "macos:>=15"] }
  }
}
```

Supported predicate forms include `linux`, `macos`, `linux:fedora`, `linux:rhel-like`, `linux:ubuntu:>=24.04`, `macos:>=15`, negation such as `!linux:nixos`, and arrays for any-of matching.

## 9. Key Rules

- A profile with no `groups.include` has no deny rules. Always include appropriate deny groups for untrusted workloads.
- `filesystem.bypass_protection` only removes the deny rule. It does not grant access. A matching filesystem or Unix socket field must also grant the requested access.
- `filesystem.suppress_save_prompt` only suppresses save-profile suggestions. It does not grant access, remove deny rules, or hide diagnostics.
- `groups.exclude` removes groups from the resolved set. This weakens the sandbox. Use it only when you understand which protections you are removing.
- `extends` chains resolve recursively up to depth 10. Circular inheritance is an error.
- `platform_overrides` is applied after all `extends` inheritance is resolved. The override for the current platform is merged as a child, so its values win over inherited ones. Override blocks cannot themselves use `extends` or `platform_overrides`.
- Prefer `when` predicates for package-specific platform differences. Put shared OS baseline paths in built-in policy groups instead.
- `network.block: true` blocks all network access. It cannot be combined with proxy settings.
- `custom_credentials` upstream URLs must use HTTPS. HTTP is only accepted for loopback addresses (localhost, 127.0.0.1, ::1).
